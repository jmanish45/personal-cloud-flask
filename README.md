📝 Project Overview
This project is a personal cloud storage system built with Python and Flask. It provides a simple web interface for users to upload, manage, and access their files, simulating a lightweight, self-hosted version of services like Google Drive. The long-term goal is to integrate AI for smart search and automatic file organization.

✅ Features of this Project
File Management: ✅ Upload, view, and download files of any type.

Secure Deletion: ✅ Delete files with a confirmation step to prevent accidental loss.

User Feedback: ✅ Clear on-screen messages confirm successful actions.

User Accounts: 🚧 Secure registration and login for private, individualized storage.

AI-Powered Search: 🔜 Future capability to search files based on their content, not just filenames.

Smart Categorization: 🔜 Planned feature for AI to automatically sort files into categories like "Documents," "Images," and "Receipts."

Status Key: ✅ Implemented | 🚧 In Progress | 🔜 Planned
