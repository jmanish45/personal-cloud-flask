Areas for Improvement

Add type hints for better code documentation
Implement logging instead of print statements
Add unit tests for AI functions

🔮 Future Vision Alignment
Your project has solid foundations for the planned features:

✅ Smart Search → Already implemented with semantic matching
✅ Auto-Categorization → Working with Gemini AI
✅ File Sharing → Token-based system in place
⏳ User Accounts → Need profile pages, quotas, settings

💡 Advanced Feature Ideas:
Once this is working, you could add:

Project Detection: If multiple code files are uploaded from same folder, group them as "ProjectName Files"
Video Thumbnails: Extract first frame for preview
Audio Transcription: Use speech-to-text for audio files (Whisper API)
Better Video Analysis: Extract keyframes and analyze with Gemini Vision

Ready to implement this? Let me know if you want me to also update the app.py to show file type icons or create a separate "Projects" view for code files! 🚀
